# HTTP/Upgrade

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade

The [[HTTP#1.1]] (only) `Upgrade` header can be used to upgrade an already established client/server connection to a different protocol (over the same transport protocol).

For example, it can be used by a client to upgrade a connection from [[HTTP#1.1]] to [[HTTP#2.0]], or an [[HTTP]] or [[HTTP/HTTPS]] connection into a [[HTTP/WebSocket]].
