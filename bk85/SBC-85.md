I agree with you that it is easier to build hardware around the 8085 rather than the 8080. That is why I built the SBC-85.COM project based on the 8085. However it doesn’t hurt to learn about the 8080 first since most concepts carry forward. I like the 8080 bugbook by Rony, Larsen, & Titus. With that understanding, you should be able to understand the intel MCS-85 family user guide. Of course don’t forget the intel SDK-85 schematic and users manual. Then spend considerable time looking over the schematics of any of the 8085 projects that are readily available online and have downloadable schematics and user guides. Also look over vintage hardware schematics such as intel multibus single board computers. Once you are to the point that 90% of the schematics make sense, then you can venture out into the world of laying out your own design. For each part go to some reference schematics you collected earlier (intel, online projects, etc) and focus on the little sub part you are working on, e.g., memory decoding. On your first boards include many test points and extra gates that you can patch into as corrections are needed. Of course it was different when that was all we had, but from my perspective, front panel switches are fun for about a month. Hex keypad for about six months. Then either gets in the way of programming so eventually the terminal interface becomes my preferred interface.
