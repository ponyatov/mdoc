# Learn [[Rust]] With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists

https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/

I fairly frequently get asked how to implement a [[linked list]] in Rust. The answer honestly depends on what your requirements are, and it's obviously not super easy to answer the question on the spot. As such I've decided to write this book to comprehensively answer the question once and for all.

In this series I will teach you basic and advanced Rust programming entirely by having you implement 6 linked lists. In doing so, you should learn:

-   The following pointer types: `&`, `&mut`, [[Box]], [[Rc]], [[Arc]], `*const`, `*mut`, [[NonNull]] (?)
-   [[Ownership]], [[borrowing]], [[inherited mutability]], [[interior mutability]], [[Copy]]
-   All The Keywords: [[struct]], [[enum]], [[fn]], [[pub]], [[impl]], [[use]], ...
-   [[Pattern matching]], [[wp]]s, [[destructor]]s
-   Testing, installing new toolchains, using [[miri]]
-   [[Rust/Unsafe|Unsafe Rust]]: [[raw pointer]]s, [[aliasing]], [[stacked borrow]]s, [UnsafeCell], [[variance]]
