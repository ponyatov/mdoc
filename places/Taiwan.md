# Taiwan

In [[Taiwan]], the Environmental Protection Administration uses a monitoring network for air quality for the people to view; however, these data only show a large-scale area and there is no way to know the actual situations in homes. The quality of indoor air is the closest to peopleâ€™s [[living environment]].
