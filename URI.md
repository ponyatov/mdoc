# URI
## Uniform Resource Identifier

The next part of the request line is `/`, which indicates the _Uniform Resource Identifier_ ([[URI]]) the client is requesting: a URI is almost, but not quite, the same as a _Uniform Resource Locator_ _([[URL]])_. The difference between URIs and URLs isn’t important for our purposes in this chapter, but the [[HTTP]] spec uses the term URI, so we can just mentally substitute URL for URI here.
