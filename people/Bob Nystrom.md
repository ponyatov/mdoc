# Bob Nystrom

[[people/Bob Nystrom]]'s [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) is recommended _introductory_ reading to this book for beginners to the topic. Bob has produced a high quality, accessible work and while there is considerable overlap, in some ways this book builds on Bob's work with some additional complexity, optimizations and discussions of Rust's safe vs unsafe.
