This [[PyQt5]] tutorial shows how to use [[Python3]] and [[Qt]] to create a GUI on [[Windows]], Mac or [[Linux]]. It even covers [[creating an installer]] for your app.

## What is [[PyQt5]]?

[[PyQt]] is a library that lets you use the Qt [[GUI framework]] from Python. Qt itself is written in [[C++]]. By using it from Python, 
- **you can build applications much more quickly** 
- while not sacrificing much of the speed of C++.

[[PyQt5]] refers to the most recent version 5 of Qt. You may still find the occasional mention of (Py)Qt4 on the web, but it is old and no longer supported.
