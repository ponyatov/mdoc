# UCK
## [[Ubuntu]] Customized Kit

**UCK is perhaps one of the best known**. This program with a graphical interface allows you to use a series of scripts that allow you to customize an Ubuntu ISO and derivatives to create your custom distribution. You can choose the desktop environment, install or uninstall some packages, etc.
