# Xyce
## analogue circuit simulator

`Xyce` is an open source, [[SPICE]]-compatible, high-performance analogue [[circuit simulator]], capable of 
> - solving extremely large circuit problems when 
> - installed on large-scale parallel computing platforms. 

It also supports serial execution on all common desktop platforms, and small-scale parallel execution on Unix-like systems. Xyce for Linux, Microsoft Windows, and MacOS can be downloaded from the official Xyce website at https://xyce.sandia.gov/Xyce. The Xyce parallel circuit simulator running on [[Linux]] requires installation of the [[openMPI]] libraries. [[spice4qucs]] supports both Xyce-Serial and Xyce-Parallel (not currently available for the Microsoft Windows operating system).
