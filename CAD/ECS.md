## What Is An Entity-Component-System?
https://adventures.michaelfbryan.com/posts/ecs-outside-of-games/#what-is-an-entity-component-system

- follows the _composition over inheritance_ principle
- *every object* in a game’s scene is an **entity** labeled with id
- entity consists of one or more **components** which *add behavior or functionality*
- behavior of an entity can be changed at runtime by adding or removing components
- **systems** runs as threads performing global actions on the every entity group marked with component associated with the corresponding system

or

- **Entity**: The entity is a general purpose object. Usually, it only consists of a **unique id** tags every coarse gameobject as a separate item.
- **Component**: The raw data *for one aspect* of the object, and how that labeled object interacts with the world.
- **System**: Each System runs continuously (like having its own private thread) and performs global actions on every Entity that possesses a Component of the same aspect as that System.

## Inheritance isn’t Always the Best Tool for the Job

**cross-cutting concerns** in CADs:
- Graphical entities (e.g. `Point`, `Line`, `Spline`) which are rendered to the screen
- Non-graphical entities which impart semantics to the drawing (individually managed `Layer`s)
- Both graphical and non-graphical entities can be `frozen` (made immutable) or `hidden` (made invisible)
- Entities can be given a `name` so users associate them with a concept
- graphical entities need different information for how to be rendered (e.g. a `Line` might just have a `stroke_colour`, while a `Circle` may also have a `fill_colour`)
