[[Spec2]] is a framework in Pharo for describing User Interfaces.

I am building a simple [application](https://github.com/rakki-18/Matrix-Benchmarks) in Spec2 to run Pharo Matrix Benchmarks, as part of my [[GSoC]] **2021** project.

I will go over the steps to build the GUI in this blog.

### Learning [[Spec]]2

If you are looking to learn Spec2, the `Help`>`Spec2 examples` in the Pharo image are really helpful. They come with a lot of demos for using the Spec2 UI framework and also show the code for it alongside.

Also, check out the [[Pharo/Spec/TODO tutorial]] to get a hang of developing applications with spec2.
