## functional programming

- [[imperative programming]]: freely mutates state
- **functional programming**: avoid mutable state 
	- by returning new version of data structure
		- [[persistent data structure]]
		- [[pure function]]

- all [[IO]] stuff is inherently mutable: [[monad]]
- real life FP is about 
	- contraint the use of stateful code 
	- but not eliminating it entirely
