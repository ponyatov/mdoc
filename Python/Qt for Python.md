# Qt for Python
## An interesting new competitor to [[PyQt]]
#Py #Qt

An interesting new competitor to PyQt is [[Qt for Python]]. Its API is virtually identical. Unlike [[PyQt]], it is 
- **licensed under the LGPL** and 
- can thus be used for free in commercial projects.

It's backed by the Qt company, and thus likely the future. We use PyQt mostly because it is more mature. Since the APIs are so similar, you can easily switch your apps to [[Qt for Python]] later.
