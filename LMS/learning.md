The best way to start [[LMS/learning]] something is to jump right in. Imagine one of those ball pits kids get to play in but, sadly, us adults are usually forbidden. As learners, our first exposure to new material is like jumping into this pit, surrounded by a dizzying array of colors and buried up to our necks in confusion. As we struggle to make our way to the far end of the ball pit, we gradually get our footing, the colors become more familiar, the shape and landscape of the ball pit gets smaller, and we’re able to reason about it. After a while, we crawl out of the pit, having learned enough that we’re eager to jump back in and discover more.
