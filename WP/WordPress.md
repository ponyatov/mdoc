# WordPress
## [[CMS]]

[[WordPress]] is the most dominant content management system written in [[PHP]], combined with [[MySQL]] or [[MariaDB]] database. You can create and maintain a site without prior web development or coding knowledge.

The first version of WordPress was created in 2003 by [[Matt Mullenweg]] and [[Mike Little]] and is now used by 70% of the known web market, according to [[W3Tech]]. WordPress comes in two versions:
- the free open source WordPress.org and 
- [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com), a paid service that starts at $5 per month up to $59.

Using this content management system is easy and often seen as a stepping stone for making a blog or similar featured site.
