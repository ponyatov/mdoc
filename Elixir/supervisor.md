# supervisor
# `супервизор`

Elixir’s documentation describes a [supervisor](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html) as follows:

> A **supervisor** is a *process which supervises other processes*, which we refer to as **child processes**. Supervisors are used to build a hierarchical process structure called a [[supervision tree]]. Supervision trees provide [[fault-tolerance]] and encapsulate how our applications start and shutdown.
